decided, the train is released (for that date) into the “booking system” for ticket booking.
5. The number of berths and type of berths (lower, middle, upper, etc) are fixed in an AC coach and a Sleeper coach.

booking is allowed only if the particular train of interest is released into the “booking system” for the date of
interest by the Admin.
